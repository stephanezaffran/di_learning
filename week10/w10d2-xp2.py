# Exercise 1
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.
#


#
# Exercise 2
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01hours).
#
#
# Exercise 3
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a birthdate as an argument (in the format of your choice), then display a message stating how many minutes the user has been alive.
#
#
# Exercise 4
# Instructions
# Write a function that display todayâ€™s date.
# The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming holiday and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
# Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.
#
#
# Exercise 5 : How Old Are You On Jupiter?
# Instructions
# Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
# Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
# Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
# Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
# Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
# Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
# Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
# Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
# Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
# So if you are told someone is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, the function should output that they are 31.69 Earth-years old.

# Exercise 6 : Faker Module
# Instructions
# Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. Use faker to populate them with fake data.

# Create a file called operators.py
#
# Create 2 functions : addOperator(x,y) that returns the addition of 2 numbers, and divideOperator(x,y) that returns the division of 2 numbers
#
#
# Do this process 3 times :
#
# once by importing the whole module
# the second time by importing specific functions
# the third time by using alias

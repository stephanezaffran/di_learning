# Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:
#

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'



class Circle:
    def __init__(self, diameter):
      self.diameter = diameter

    def grow(self, factor=2):
        """grows the circle's diameter by factor"""
        self.diameter = self.diameter * 2

class NewCircle(Circle):
    def grow(self, factor=2):
        """grows the area by factor..."""
        self.diameter = (self.diameter *4)



class A():

    def dothis(self):
        print("doing this in A")


class B(A):
    pass


class C():
    def dothis(self):
        print("doing this in C")


class D(B, C):
    pass

d_instance = D()
d_instance.dothis() 
#
# Create another cat breed. In order to do so, create a class which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a few cat instances.
# Create a list called my_cats, which will hold all the created cat instances.
# Create a variable called my_pets. It’s value is an instance of the Pet class.
# Hint : Use the my_cats variable to create the instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.
#
#
# Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value should be another dog called other_dog, returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.
#
# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.
#
#
# Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True
#
# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other dogs (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.
#
# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# “dog_name does a barrel roll”.
# “dog_name stands on his back legs”.
# “dog_name shakes your hand”.
# “dog_name plays dead”.
